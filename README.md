## 🔍 Key Contributions

* **KAN-based GAN (KAN-GAN):**
  Incorporation of Kolmogorov–Arnold Networks into the GAN discriminator for efficient modeling of high-dimensional nonlinear relationships with fewer parameters.

* **GA-Tuned Differential Evolution (GA–DE):**
  A hierarchical evolutionary optimization strategy where GA adaptively tunes DE control parameters for robust and automated hyperparameter optimization.

* **Application to AVSS:**
  Joint optimization of Voice Conversion (VC) and Audio-Visual Synthesis (AVS) for generating synchronized speech audio and facial video.

* **Improved Stability and Quality:**
  Enhanced adversarial balance, reduced training instability, and improved perceptual quality compared to conventional optimization approaches.
